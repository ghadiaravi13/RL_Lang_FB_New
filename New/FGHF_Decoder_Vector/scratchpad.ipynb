It records the sending of seventy disciples by Jesus, the famous parable about the Good Samaritan, and his visit to the house of Mary and Martha. The book containing this chapter is anonymous, but early Christian tradition uniformly affirmed that Luke composed this Gospel as well as Acts. The New King James Version organises this chapter as follows (with cross references to parallel sections in the other gospels): Theologian Heinrich Meyer calls this section the \"Narrative of the Seventy\" and links it to the earlier account of the sending out of advance messengers in. This parable is recounted only in this chapter of the New Testament. A lawyer or 'expert in the law' asked Jesus to explain who his 'neighbour' is, referring to the ordinance of Leviticus 19:18: In response, Jesus told a story of a traveller (who may or may not have been a Jew ) who is beaten, robbed, and left half dead along the road. First a priest and then a Levite come by, but both avoid the man. Finally, a Samaritan comes by. Samaritans and Jews generally despised each other, but the Samaritan helps the injured man. Portraying a Samaritan in a positive light would have come as a shock to Jesus's audience.\n",

A lawyer or \\'expert in the law\\' asked Jesus to explain who his \\'neighbour\\' is, referring to the ordinance of Leviticus 19:18: In response, Jesus told a story of a traveller (who may or may not have been a Jew ) who is beaten, robbed, and left half dead along the road. First a priest and then a Levite come by, but both avoid the man. Finally, a Samaritan comes by. Samaritans and Jews generally despised each other, but the Samaritan helps the injured man.

Some editions append it to the end of -, and the rule does seem to be an expansion on the teaching about prayer in that section. However, the word therefore and the mention of the law and the prophets implies that this is a more far reaching teaching. Davies and Allison note that this is indicated by the mention of the law and the prophets, which links the verse back to Matthew 5:17, the start of the teaching on ethics. The verse is most closely linked with the teaching to \"love thy enemies\" in. In the Rule is present just after the teaching about enemies, making the link even more explicit. Luz notes that as well as summarizing the sermon, this rule also adapts it to normal life.
